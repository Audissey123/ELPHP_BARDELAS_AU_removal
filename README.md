About the App
Community Skill Exchange is a web API built with Laravel that lets people trade skills instead of using money. For example, someone who knows how to play guitar can offer lessons, and in return, ask for help with fixing their computer. It’s a way for people to help each other by sharing their talents.

This app is useful for communities, students, or anyone who wants to learn something new or share what they know — all without spending money.
